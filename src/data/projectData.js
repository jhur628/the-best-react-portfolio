Wouldn't it be nice if you can reserve a laundry machine and avoid all your quirky neighbors. Now you can! With Dibs, you can make reservations for washing/drying machines. Gone are the days of seeing your floor in a pile next to the trash can. No more missing of a singular sock. Maybe the best way to co-exist is to avoid people altogether. Thank you, Dibs!",
