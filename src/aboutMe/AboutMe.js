            <p>
                My name is John Hur. Born in Germany June 28, 1990, I began my crazy existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked in social services and counseling for about seven years. It was rewarding, but at the same time, it was very taxing. I am very grateful for the experience and lessons I've obtained within the field.
                I learned how to be more disciplined, how to be part of a team, how to learn, how to problem solve, and how to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always wanted to learn to code, and 2021, I made the first step towards becoming a full stack developer. I enrolled in Northwestern's coding full-stack bootcamp. I realized immediately this is where I belong.
                It was challenging, but I pushed and developed, both my applications and my character as a coder. I could have been an average student, and coasted through the bootcamp in the middle. Instead, I joined a study group where my peers and friends pushed me, helped eliminate inadequacies, and provided support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am proud of my applications. I want to be able to continue to be proud of what I do. I want to create, grow, work with a great team, help grow a great team into a greater team, and I want to continue to move forward.
                This is where I belong, and I'm just happy to be here.
